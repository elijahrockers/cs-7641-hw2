This assignment was written primarily around mlrose-hiive, which is included in hw2.yml. The runners.py files are used to generate the experiments, which export the data into csv/txt files.
To generate the plots, see experiments/plot_*.py files which contain the necessary code for converting the exported csv into relevant plots.
